# About Me

I'm currently becoming a Data Scientist.

Previously (and still am) a chip design engineer with years experience developing all sorts of chips for all sorts of companies.

With respect to chip design, I've worked a lot in design verification, but have experience in [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture), [micro-architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture), [circuit design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_design), implementation, and [design verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_verification), and [electronic design automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation).

When it comes to data science, I'm interested in anything. I'd like to learn more about [re-enforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning), [generative models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model), and [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing).
